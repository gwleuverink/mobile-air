 * Moves an async task between the dispatching (UI) PHP context and the

 * touching a database or the standard queue.
 *
 * The payload (a PHP-serialized work envelope) is handed off through a temp
 * file under `storage/framework/async/` — the async lane and the UI lane share
 * the app's filesystem, so no native RAM courier is needed. Completion, though,
 * must WAKE the UI runloop, which differs by environment:
 *
 *   - Device: `AsyncTask.Complete` bridge call → native `sendNativeEvent(...)` →
 *     `nphp_element_post_event` unblocks `nativephp_element_wait_event()`.
 *   - Jump (dev machine): the runloop is a plain PHP process polling over TCP;
 *     the subprocess writes a completion spool file that the Jump
 *     `nativephp_element_wait_event()` polyfill drains and returns as an event.
