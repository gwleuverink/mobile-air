/**
 * In-process stand-in for the async lane, enabled with {@see AsyncTask::fake()}.
 *
 * While active, every `AsyncTask::dispatch()` runs its work **inline and
 * synchronously** and its `finished()`/`failed()` callback fires immediately —
 * so tests exercise the whole flow with no threads, bridge, or device — and each
 * dispatch is recorded for assertions.
 *
 * The result still goes through the same JSON normalization the device transport
 * applies ({@see AsyncTaskRunner::normalizeResult()}), so a test can't pass on a
 * value that wouldn't survive the real hop: objects arrive as arrays, and a
 * non-encodable result fails the task here exactly as it would on a device.
 * Task-subclass arguments are deep-copied through serialize/unserialize for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * One divergence remains on purpose: a work CLOSURE is invoked directly rather
 * than round-tripped, so anything it captured is shared by identity here and a
 * deep copy on a device. Unserializing a closure re-evaluates its source in the
 * namespace reflection reports for it, which for a closure written in a test
 * file is the test runner's compiled namespace — so reproducing the hop here
 * would break class resolution in a way a real dispatch never does. Assert on
 * what the work returns, not on objects it mutates through a capture.
 *
 *   $fake = AsyncTask::fake();
 *   $component->tap('generateReport');
 *   $fake->assertDispatched();
